Scene Toggle
==========

A plugin for the Indigo home automation system (http://indigodomo.com)

Scene Toggle is just as the name implies, lets you toggle on and off a scene.  While this functionality exists in Indigo already by using virtual devices this plugin takes it a step further.

The scene device lets you choose which On/Off or Dimmable devices in your network that you want included in the scene.  You set the devices to be off, on or the brightness you desire and the device takes a "snapshot" of the devices for the scene.

Scene Toggle on Indigo 6
-------------------
If you are using Indigo 6 then you will need to install Scene Toggle version 1.0, that is the last Indigo 6 stable release.  No further development, short of major bug squashing, will be done for any version prior to 2.0.
